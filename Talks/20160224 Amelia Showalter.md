**Title:** The Art and Science of A/B Testing, Experiments Design and Optimization  
&nbsp;  

### General Lessons  
**Testing = Constant Improvement**  

- Little improvements add up: Improving 1% here and there isn't a lot at first, but over time it adds up

**Don't trust your gut**

  - Conventional wisdom is often wrong
  - Long-held best practices are often wrong
  - You are not your audience

**Foster a culture of testing**

  - Check your ego at the door
  - Use every opportunity to test something
  - Compare against yourself, not against your competitors or "the industry"
  - When in doubt, test
  - In a culture of testing, all questions are answered empirically
  
**Invest in your team**

  - Hire smart, diverse talent
  - Experience less important than aptitude & passion
  - Hire multi-talented "translators" (e.g. between data and plain English)

### Email Testing Lessons  
- Usually waiting for 1 hour to see amount of fundraising was enough.
  - 1 hour was usually long enough, waiting longer usually didn't change the result.
  - Sometimes there is a case for not waiting so long as you want the actual email to be sent under the similar conditions as the test.
- In general, shorter, less formal emails and subject lines did best.
- When the subject line had a mild curse word in it, it tended to win(!).
- Issues with saturation?  
  - Rerandomisation every time. (Important!)
  Everyone just got one email.
  - **Is there such a thing as too much email?** (Ran a test, sending more email didn't seem to turn people off too much.)
- Multivariate tests
  - Testing more than 1 variable at the same time
  - Efficient
  - Can observe interaction effects, if any
&nbsp;

### Segmentation  
**Be careful of geographical and demographic segmentation**

- Be careful of using geography as a proxy for other characteristics.
  - E.g. People in rich neighbourhoods did not respond to higher donation requests for the Obama campaign.
- Demographic segmentation is tricky: they do not tell the whole story about a person.
  - E.g. Communication in Spanish. US has large population of Latin American origin, easy to identify them by name. But most Latinos in the US prefer to communicate in English. Writing to them in Spanish could be seen as an insult.

**Other Points**
  
- Behavioural segmentation is best.
  - Past behaviour is a good predictor for future behaviour.
- Segmentation can be extra work
- May miss opportunities for A/B testing
  - Smaller semgents => smaller sample size
- Personalization datasets good way to get benefits of segmentation while still being able to run tests.

### Testing across multiple media
- Not so different from any other kind of A/B testing, you just have to keep control of your audience.
  - E.g. Users who have access to both email and Facebook. If you split them into 2 groups, serve both emails but only give 1 group Facebook ads, can test the effect of serving Facebook ads.
- Communication in one medium can influence the effectiveness of communications in another medium.
  - E.g. in previous example, those that got Facebook ads actually donated more money through email (compared to control group).

Sometimes you want to test the effectiveness of the medium itself.

### Social and Mobile Outreach
A/B testing is difficult or impossible with social media as you can't randomise (exceptions: Facebook/Twitter ads).

**Know the local language**: Each social media platform has its own culture. **The best content is tailored to that particular platform's culture.**  

- Twitter good for short discussions/conversations.
- Facebook's algorithm favours photo and video content.
- E.g. TSA's Instagram account
  - TSA's popular Instagram cross-promotes TSA's other social media feeds (e.g. Twitter)
- E.g. NASA's Twitter feed
- E.g. City of New York Facebook


**Text messaging can be an avenue for providing important public services.**

- Culture of text messaging
  - Somehwere between email and Twitter
  - Short, informal, informative, interactive
  - Conversational
- **Text messaging is testable**

**Can Whatsapp be harnessed for the benefit of the public?**

- Case study: Canada *Globe & Mail* Whatsapp. Launched a service to inform voters about the election and candidates. Sent texts via Whatsapp throughout election season.
  - Got a lot of positive feedback from Whatsapp subscribers
  - Very few subscribers ifnored their Whatsapp messages
  - BUT has many logistical downsides
    - Had to do everything through one person's phone (although Whatsapp for Desktop may help)
    - Broadcast lists have max of 256 people
    - No easy way for users to unsubscribe
  - In the end, *Globe & Mail* decided to discontinue the program.
