**Title:** Measuring and predicting human behaviour using online data  
&nbsp;  

### General Lessons  

- Every data source has its biases.
- Comparing behaviour across countries can run into the problem of translating across languages (and whether terms mean the same thing in different languages).  
  - Numbers seem to avoid this problem.  
- **Calibration challenge for mobile data:** What is the relationship between the number of mobile connections in an area and the number of people actually there?  
  - Events are a good opportunity to do such calibration (e.g. football games).  
  - In study done comparing various modes (e.g. call, SMS, internet connection), internet connection was found to be the best proxy for actual number of people present.  
  - Makes sense as background internet activity still happens even if the person is not actively using the phone.  
- How do you account for change of behaviour over time?  
  - One possibility is to set up a model that retrains itself for a sliding time window.
