**Location:** Oakland Marriott City Center
**Speaker:** Edward Tufte
**Title:** Presenting Data and Information

### General Lessons
* Quotes from authorities lend credibility to your work and help your audience learn the jargon of the field.
* Always provide sources/documentation: integrity, credibility.
* There is no relationship between the amount of information and the ease of reading.
* Don't pre-specify your method: do what it takes to present your content.

### General Data Visualization Tips
* The purpose of information display is to assist reasoning of its content.
* Use direct labeling where possible instead of codes (e.g. color codes).
* Adjacent in space is more effective than adjacent in time (slower rate of information transfer). Adjacent in space also allows different people to look at the different things they are interested in at the same time.
* Data graphics can go anywhere a word or number can go.

### How to make a presentation
1. **Preparation.** You need content and credibility.
    * Try to minimize jargon. Most concepts can be explained in everyday language.
    * At some point, good to demonstrate your mastery of detail.
    * As a practioner, good to "go to the ground" and see how measurements are made. (In general you will be horrified!)
2. **Practice.**
    * Rehearse: In front of others, video, audio. It's rough but it will fix the problems.
    * Endlessly respect your audience. If not, you will tend to dumb down or pander.
    * Think the best you can about them. Don't assume your audience is stupid.
    * You are trying to make everybody smart.
3. **Show up early, no matter what.**
    * Sign of respect for your audience.
    * Fix last-minute problems that might crop up.
    * Say hello, talk to people.
4. **Begin with a document, not a deck.**
    * Documents are "high-resolution data dumps".
    * The audience can read 2-3 times faster than you can talk.
    * Distribute at the beginning of the meeting as people are coming in.
    * Institute "study time" at the beginning of the meeting, instead of you talking.
    * Give a lot of material upfront. The first act of the viewer is reading/choosing what to read from a variety of things.
    * E.g. Amazon.
5. **End.**
    * You can end routinely early.
