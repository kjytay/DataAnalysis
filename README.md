# Data Analysis

This repository is to help me keep track of all the stuff I have on data analysis.


- **Data Analysis for Python (Intro):** A series of IPython notebooks which I typed up while working through "Python for Data Analysis" by William Wesley McKinney (Oâ€™Reilly). (Copyright 2012 William McKinney, ISBN 978-1-449-31979-3.)
- **Talks:** My notes for talks I've attended on data analysis.  
(*Note*: These are my own notes and hence represent my interpretation of the talk and other lessons I learnt. They are **not** necessarily representative of the speaker's views.)
